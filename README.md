# SVG-EDITOR
A school project at MULTIMEDIA in which implemented an editor with SVG elements. In my app you can draw shapes such as rectangle, ellipse, line. Also, you can move,delete,change properties(color,stroke width,opacity), undo/redo some operations. And if you wanna save the canvas, you have option to png or jpeg.
